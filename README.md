# SimpleEmotions
Main goal of this repository is to keep some basic NNs and algorithms to process human emotions basing on photos and viseos.

Most of modern work in AI applications in face  are based on  [Facial Action Coding System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_Action_Coding_System). It was originally invented by a Swedish scientist Carl-Herman Hjortsj√∂ and subsequently developed by Paul Ekman and Wallace V. Friesen. 

This repository contains some basic tools that are based on artifical newuro nets and can be used to analyse emotions on images of faces.
